# Deepfake Detector

Deepfake Detector is a Python library designed for detecting deepfake content in images and videos. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, it provides an easy-to-use interface for real-time and batch processing of media files.

## Features

- Real-time Deepfake Detection: Analyze live video feeds to detect deepfake content.
- Batch Processing: Process multiple images and videos to classify them as real or fake.
- Customizable Thresholds: Adjust detection sensitivity to suit your specific needs.

## Installation

You can install the `deepfake_detector` package using pip:

```bash
pip install deepfake_detector
```

## Usage

### For Video Detection

Detect deepfake content in a video file. You can provide a video file path or use a webcam.

```python
from deepfake_detector import DeepfakeDetector

# Create a detector object with a custom threshold
detector = DeepfakeDetector(threshold=0.5)

# Detect deepfakes in a video file
detector.detect_from_video('path_to_video.mp4')

# Use webcam (source=0) for live detection
detector.detect_from_video(source=0)
```

### For Image Detection

Detect deepfake content in a single image.

```python
from deepfake_detector import DeepfakeDetector

# Create a detector object with a custom threshold
detector = DeepfakeDetector(threshold=0.5)

# Detect deepfakes in an image
result = detector.detect_from_image('path_to_image.jpg')
print(f'The image is classified as: {"FAKE" if result > 0.5 else "REAL"}')
```

### Customizing Detection Threshold

You can set the threshold to control the sensitivity of the detection.

```python
# Example with a higher sensitivity threshold
detector = DeepfakeDetector(threshold=0.7)
```
